# Amazon Shield - DDoS Protection Service

## Overview

Amazon Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS against network and transport layer attacks.

## Service Tiers

### AWS Shield Standard

- Automatically included for all AWS customers at no additional cost
- Protects against common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks
- Integrated with CloudFront and Route 53

### AWS Shield Advanced

- Paid service offering enhanced DDoS protection
- 24/7 access to AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT)
- Real-time attack monitoring and reporting
- Protection against more sophisticated attacks

## Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce website experiencing the following setup:

```
example.com/
├── Web Application (hosted on EC2)
├── CloudFront Distribution
├── Application Load Balancer
└── Route 53 DNS
```

### Architecture with Shield Protection

                                    Shield Protection
                                           ↓
[Users] → [Route 53] → [CloudFront] → [ALB] → [EC2 Instances]
                            ↑            ↑           ↑
                    DDoS Protection  Network ACL  Security Groups
```

### Common Attack Scenarios

1. **SYN Flood Attack**
   - Attacker sends many SYN requests
   - Shield automatically detects and mitigates

2. **UDP Reflection Attack**
   - Attacker uses amplification techniques
   - Shield blocks suspicious traffic patterns

## Best Practices

1. Enable Shield Advanced for critical applications
2. Implement AWS WAF alongside Shield
3. Use CloudFront for edge protection
4. Configure health-based routing in Route 53

## Cost Consideration

- Shield Standard: Free
- Shield Advanced: $3,000 per month (1-year commitment)
  - Includes protection for unlimited resources
  - DRT support
  - Cost protection during DDoS attacks
