# AWS Instance Storage (Instance Store) Guide

## What is Instance Storage?

Instance Storage (also known as Instance Store) is temporary block-level storage that is physically attached to the host computer. It provides temporary storage for instances that need high-speed, low-latency access to data.

### Key Characteristics

- **Temporary Storage**: Data is lost when the instance stops or terminates
- **Physically Attached**: Storage is directly connected to the host hardware
- **High Performance**: Provides very high IOPS and low latency
- **No Additional Cost**: Included in the instance price
- **Instance-Specific**: Cannot be detached or reattached to other instances

## When to Use Instance Storage

### Ideal Use Cases

1. **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**
   - Scientific computing workloads
   - Financial modeling and simulations
   - Real-time data processing

2. **Temporary Data Processing**
   - Batch processing jobs
   - Data transformation pipelines
   - Log processing and analysis

3. **Caching and Buffering**
   - Application-level caching
   - Database query caching
   - Temporary file storage

4. **Development and Testing**
   - Build artifacts and temporary files
   - Test data that doesn't need persistence
   - Development environment scratch space

5. **Media Processing**
   - Video encoding/transcoding
   - Image processing
   - Audio file manipulation

### When NOT to Use Instance Storage

- **Persistent Data**: Data that must survive instance termination
- **Shared Data**: Data that needs to be accessed by multiple instances
- **Backup Requirements**: Data that needs regular backups
- **Production Databases**: Critical data that requires high availability

## Why Instance Storage is Important

### Performance Benefits

1. **High IOPS**: Can provide up to millions of IOPS
2. **Low Latency**: Direct hardware connection eliminates network overhead
3. **High Throughput**: Excellent for sequential read/write operations
4. **Predictable Performance**: Consistent performance without throttling

### Cost Benefits

1. **No Additional Cost**: Included in instance pricing
2. **No Storage Charges**: No per-GB storage fees
3. **No Data Transfer Costs**: No charges for data movement

### Architectural Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No need for separate storage management
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates storage attachment/detachment overhead
3. **Faster Boot Times**: No need to wait for external storage attachment

# HDD drives (d2, h1 instances)
/dev/xvda, /dev/xvdb, /dev/xvdc, etc.
```

## Working with Instance Storage

### Checking Available Instance Storage

```bash
# List all block devices
lsblk

# Check disk space
df -h

# View detailed disk information
sudo fdisk -l
```

### Creating File Systems

```bash
# For NVMe SSD
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1

# For HDD
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdb
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb
```

### Mounting Instance Storage

```bash
# Create mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/instance-storage

# Mount the device
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/instance-storage

# Verify mount
df -h
```

### Persisting Mounts Across Reboots

```bash
# Get device UUID
sudo blkid /dev/nvme1n1

# Add to fstab
echo "UUID=your-uuid /mnt/instance-storage xfs defaults,nofail 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Appropriate File System**
   - XFS for large files and high throughput
   - ext4 for general purpose workloads

2. **RAID Configuration**
   - Use RAID 0 for maximum performance
   - Use RAID 1 for redundancy (if needed)

3. **I/O Optimization**
   - Align partitions properly
   - Use appropriate block sizes

### Data Management

1. **Regular Data Sync**
   - Sync important data to persistent storage
   - Use automated scripts for data transfer

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor disk usage
   - Set up alerts for high utilization

3. **Cleanup**
   - Regularly clean up temporary files
   - Implement automated cleanup scripts

### Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storing
   - Use application-level encryption

2. **Access Control**
   - Set appropriate file permissions
   - Use IAM roles for application access

## Common Use Case Examples

### Example 1: High-Performance Data Processing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Mount instance storage for data processing

# Mount all available instance storage
for device in /dev/nvme*n1; do
    if [ -b "$device" ]; then
        mount_point="/mnt/instance-$(basename $device)"
        sudo mkdir -p $mount_point
        sudo mount $device $mount_point
    fi
done

# Process data using instance storage
python process_data.py --input /mnt/instance-nvme1n1/input --output /mnt/instance-nvme2n1/output

# Sync results to persistent storage
aws s3 sync /mnt/instance-nvme2n1/output s3://my-bucket/results/
```

### Example 2: Database Caching

```bash
# Mount instance storage for database cache
sudo mkdir /mnt/db-cache
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/db-cache

# Configure database to use instance storage for cache
mysql -e "SET GLOBAL innodb_data_home_dir = '/mnt/db-cache';"
```

### Example 3: Build Server

```bash
# Mount instance storage for build artifacts
sudo mkdir /mnt/build-cache
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/build-cache

# Configure build tools to use instance storage
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.repo.local=/mnt/build-cache/.m2/repository"
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Monitor I/O performance
iostat -x 1

# Check disk health
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme1n1

# Monitor disk I/O
iotop
```

### Common Issues and Solutions
