# AWS Disaster Recovery Strategies

This document outlines the four main disaster recovery strategies in AWS with real-world examples and architecture patterns.

## 1. Backup and Restore

### Overview

- Lowest cost DR strategy
- Data and applications are backed up regularly
- Recovery time is longest among all strategies

### Real-world Example

A small e-commerce company backs up their product database and application code nightly to Amazon S3, with the ability to restore to EC2 instances when needed.

### Architecture

```
[Production Environment]
    EC2 + RDS
        ↓
    Regular Backups
        ↓
    S3 Buckets
        ↓
[DR Environment (when needed)]
    Restore to new EC2 + RDS
```

## 2. Pilot Light

### Overview

- Core services are always running
- Minimal setup running constantly
- Faster recovery than backup-restore

### Real-world Example

A financial services company keeps their critical database replicated to another region, but application servers are only launched during failover.

### Architecture

```
[Production Region]
    Active EC2 + RDS
        ↓
    Database Replication
        ↓
[DR Region]
    Standby RDS
    (EC2 AMIs ready but not running)
```

## 3. Warm Standby

### Overview

- Scaled-down version always running
- Business-critical systems active
- Medium recovery time

### Real-world Example

A healthcare application maintains a smaller version of their production environment running constantly, capable of handling critical workloads immediately.

### Architecture

```
[Production Region]
    Full-scale EC2 + RDS
        ↓
    Active-Passive Setup
        ↓
[DR Region]
    Scaled-down EC2 + RDS
    (Running but minimal capacity)
```

## 4. Hot Site / Multi-Site

### Overview

- Full production capacity
- Active-Active configuration
- Near-zero downtime
- Highest cost

### Real-world Example

A global payment processing system runs active-active infrastructure across multiple regions, with Route 53 handling traffic distribution.

### Architecture

```
[Region A]               [Region B]
Full Production     ←→   Full Production
    ↑                        ↑
    └──────┐        ┌───────┘
           ↓        ↓
     Route 53 DNS Routing
```

## Cost Comparison

| Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost |
|----------|-----|-----|------|
| Backup & Restore | Hours/Days | Hours | $ |
| Pilot Light | Hours | Minutes | $$ |
| Warm Standby | Minutes | Minutes | $$$ |
| Multi-Site | Seconds | Seconds | $$$$ |

## Best Practices

1. Regular testing of recovery procedures
2. Automation of failover processes
3. Documentation of recovery steps
4. Regular updates to DR procedures
5. Monitoring and alerting setup
