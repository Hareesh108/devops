# Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in AWS

## Overview

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time after a disaster. For example, if your RPO is 1 hour, your system needs to recover all data up to 1 hour before the disaster occurred.

## Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce platform processing 1000 orders per hour:

- RPO of 1 hour = Potential loss of 1000 orders
- RPO of 5 minutes = Potential loss of ~83 orders
- RPO of near-zero = Minimal to no order loss

## AWS Solutions for Different RPO Requirements

### High RPO (24 hours)

```
Backup Strategy:
- Daily AWS Backup jobs
- S3 cross-region replication with 24-hour delay
- Daily RDS snapshots
```

### Medium RPO (1 hour)

```
Backup Strategy:
- Hourly AWS Backup jobs
- S3 cross-region replication
- Point-in-time recovery for RDS
- AWS Backup continuous backups
```

### Low RPO (minutes)

```
Architecture Components:
- Multi-AZ deployments
- S3 same-region replication
- DynamoDB global tables
- Aurora Global Database
```

### Near-Zero RPO

```
Architecture Components:
- Synchronous replication
- Multi-AZ deployments
- DynamoDB global tables with multi-master
- Aurora Global Database with managed failover
```

```

## Best Practices

1. Regularly test your recovery procedures
2. Document your RPO requirements for each application
3. Use AWS Backup to manage and monitor backup jobs
4. Implement monitoring and alerting for replication lag
5. Use AWS CloudWatch metrics to track backup status

## Cost Considerations

- Lower RPO = Higher costs
- Consider data transfer costs between regions
- Storage costs for multiple copies of data
- Additional compute resources in standby

## Monitoring RPO Compliance

```bash
# Example CloudWatch metric for Aurora replica lag
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/RDS \
  --metric-name AuroraReplicaLag \
  --dimensions Name=DBClusterIdentifier,Value=your-cluster-id \
  --start-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00 \
  --end-time 2023-01-02T00:00:00 \
  --period 300 \
  --statistics Average
```
