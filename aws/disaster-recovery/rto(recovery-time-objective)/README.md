# Recovery Time Objective (RTO) in AWS

## Overview

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable time a business can tolerate for restoring systems and services after a disaster. This document explains AWS RTO strategies with real-world examples.

## Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce platform that processes $100,000 in sales per hour:

- RTO requirement: 1 hour
- Cost of downtime: $100,000/hour
- Critical systems: Payment processing, inventory, user authentication

## AWS RTO Strategies

### 1. Pilot Light

- RTO: ~10-15 minutes
- Example components:
  - Core database replicated to standby region
  - Minimal EC2 instances running
  - Route 53 for DNS failover

### 2. Warm Standby

- RTO: ~5-10 minutes
- Active-passive setup with:
  - Scaled-down fleet of EC2 instances
  - Read replicas in standby region
  - Auto Scaling groups ready

### 3. Hot Site / Multi-Site

- RTO: ~1-2 minutes
- Active-active configuration using:
  - Multiple AWS regions
  - Global Accelerator for routing
  - DynamoDB global tables

## Implementation Example

```yaml
# AWS CloudFormation snippet
Resources:
    CrossRegionReplication:
        Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
        Properties:
            StreamSpecification:
                StreamViewType: NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
            ReplicaSettings:
                - Region: us-west-2
                    KMSMasterKeyId: alias/aws/dynamodb
```

## Best Practices

1. Regular DR testing
2. Automated failover procedures
3. Documentation and runbooks
4. Monitoring with CloudWatch
5. Regular backup validation

## Cost Considerations

- Pilot Light: 10-20% of production costs
- Warm Standby: 30-50% of production costs
- Multi-Site: 50-100% of production costs
