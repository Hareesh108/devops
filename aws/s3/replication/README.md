# Amazon S3 Replication Guide

## Overview

Amazon S3 replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across S3 buckets. This documentation covers key aspects of S3 replication and its implementation.

## Types of Replication

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Replicates objects across buckets in different AWS Regions
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: Replicates objects across buckets in the same AWS Region

## Requirements

- Source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled
- Proper IAM roles and permissions configured
- Buckets can be in same or different AWS accounts

## Common Use Cases

1. Compliance and data sovereignty requirements
2. Minimize latency for data access
3. Maintain data backups
4. Aggregate data from multiple regions

## Basic Configuration Steps

1. Enable versioning on both buckets
2. Create replication rule
3. Configure IAM roles
4. Define source and destination

## Limitations

- Existing objects are not replicated automatically
- Delete markers are not replicated by default
- Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive objects cannot be replicated

## Best Practices

- Monitor replication metrics
- Enable delete marker replication if needed
- Use appropriate storage class for destination
- Configure proper encryption settings
