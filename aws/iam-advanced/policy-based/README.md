# Amazon IAM Policy-Based Access Control

## Overview

This guide explains IAM policy-based access control in AWS with practical examples and architecture patterns.

## Architecture

## Key Components

1. **Identity-based Policies**
    - Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles
    - Control what actions the identity can perform

2. **Resource-based Policies**
    - Attached directly to resources (e.g., S3 buckets)
    - Control who can access the resource

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: E-commerce Application

Consider an e-commerce application with different teams:

```json
{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
          {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                     "s3:GetObject",
                     "s3:PutObject"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::product-images/*"
          }
     ]
}
```

This policy allows the product team to:

- Upload product images
- Retrieve product images
- Manage only the `product-images` bucket

### Best Practices

1. Use least privilege principle
2. Use groups for permission management
3. Regular policy audits
4. Enable AWS CloudTrail for monitoring
5. Use policy conditions for extra security

## Common Use Cases

1. Development team access
2. Cross-account access
3. Application-specific permissions
4. Resource-level restrictions

## Testing and Validation

- Use AWS Policy Simulator
- Implement dry runs
- Monitor CloudTrail logs
