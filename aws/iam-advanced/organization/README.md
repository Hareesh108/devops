# Amazon Organizations: Multi-Account Management

## Overview

Amazon Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts in your organization. It's like managing multiple departments within a large enterprise.

## Real-World Example

Consider a company "TechCorp" with the following structure:

- Production Environment (Account)
- Development Environment (Account)
- Testing Environment (Account)
- Security & Audit (Account)
- Billing Consolidation (Management Account)

## Architecture

```plaintext
Root (Management Account)
├── Production OU
│   ├── Web Services Account
│   └── Database Services Account
├── Development OU
│   ├── Team A Account
│   └── Team B Account
└── Security OU
    ├── Logging Account
    └── Audit Account
```

## Key Features

1. **Consolidated Billing**
   - Single payment for multiple accounts
   - Volume pricing benefits
   - Easy cost tracking

2. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
   - Restrict permissions across accounts
   - Enforce security standards
   - Control service access

3. **Centralized Management**
   - Create accounts programmatically
   - Group accounts in Organizational Units
   - Apply policies at scale

## Best Practices

1. Use separate accounts for:
   - Production workloads
   - Development/Testing
   - Security tooling
   - Log archive

2. Implement least privilege access
3. Enable AWS CloudTrail across all accounts
4. Use tagging for cost allocation

## Security Considerations

- Enable MFA on root accounts
- Regular security assessments
- Monitor account activities
- Implement compliance policies

## Cost Benefits

- Reserved Instance sharing
- Consolidated billing reports
- Simplified budget management
